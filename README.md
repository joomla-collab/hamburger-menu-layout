# Hamburger Menu - Layout Tester

I have developed a very simple, very clean tool to allow you to test the layout of a new hamburger menu.

Just play with the sizes, thickness and position.

[Check the demo](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/joomla-collab/hamburger-menu-layout/blob/master/dist/index.html)

An output code generator may be added in the future, if time allows.
